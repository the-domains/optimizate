  Ketosis is an energy state that your body uses to provide an alternative fuel
  when glucose availability is low. It happens to all humans when fasting or
  when carbohydrate intake is lowered. The process of creating ketones is a
  normal metabolic alternative designed to keep us alive if we go without food
  for long periods of time.
